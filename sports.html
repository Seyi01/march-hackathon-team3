        Qatar. The eleven starting players lined up wearing black shirts,
        spelling out "HUMAN RIGHTS" before Thursday night's game against Iceland

        Norway's football team make Qatar protest ahead of qualifying match

      <p>
        Norway's football team wore "human rights on and off the pitch" t-shirts
        before their World Cup qualifying match to protest Qatar's human rights
        record. Qatar was a controversial choice to host the next World Cup in
        2022. The Gulf nation has been under scrutiny because of its
        discriminatory laws and conditions for the migrant workers who are
        helping to build infrastructure for the event. There has been much
        debate in Norway over the Qatar World Cup with several top-division
        clubs, including Rosenborg and Tromso, calling for an outright boycott.
